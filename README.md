VR Cave DNA Visualization Demo

1. Model molecular correct base pair models in Autodesk 3ds Max (VRML97 Export).
2. Build a DNA sequence in OpenSG and CAVESceneManager as scenegraph from shallow copied models.
3. Find rotation and distance params to form the DNA helix.
4. Add a sun for lighting, which is controlled via joystick and controller tracking for moving through the scene.
5. Enable headtracking.
6. Interaction: Due to collision detection (direct placement upon atom), the sun will change its color to the corresponding basepair.
7. Immersion!
